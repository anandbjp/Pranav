  <body> Git or Github is a platform where we can download, upload or even edit files. It has a storing option too. We can
         either edit it offline or online. It is free upto 3 repositories or projects in simple language. It is a great platform 
         for beginners.
         It contains different features like Raw where you can dowload the file edited or uploaded online. It is easy to edit and 
         it is very much user friendly. I liked it very much as I learnt to operate it very much soon and it is a great experience.
