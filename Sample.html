        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is just a sample HTML file. I am just trying this out to learn and use HTML completely.
            We are planning to develope an Indian traditional game known as Ali Guli Mane. Once we learn
            HTML completely, we will start developing the game. </p>


        <p>We can save the HTML file in the computer as ".html", for example "sample.html". We can add  
           links and images along with buttons and lists. HTML also has few elements. We can change the 
           background colours. This is a part of CSS which we will learn about later.
           In a project, HTML controls the static parts, CSS makes it looks stylish and Javascript 
           controls the dynamic parts i.e., the movements invovled as in a game. </p>

        
        <p>We can also format the text type, as in the font in which we type. For example we can type in 
           style="font-family:verdana". We can also change the font size, text alignment and so on. We
           add bold texts, italic texts, subscripts, <sup>superscripts</sup> and so on. It also includes
           delete and insert texts as a function. </p>
           
           
        <p>Coming to the colours, we can put the colours for background or just as a border and can also
           adjust the RGB values. It is mainly related to the CSS part. There are different types of CSS
           such as Inline, Internal, External and so on. There a lot of other features to work on too as
           CSS Padding, Border, etc. </p>
