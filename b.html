                     one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World as listed by Hellenic culture, described
                     as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing 
                     a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed 
                     of mud bricks, and said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present
                     day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. Its name is derived from the Greek word kremastós 
                     (κρεμαστός, lit. "overhanging"), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word
                     "hanging" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace. For

                     Rhódou)[a] was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on 
                     the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders
                     of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of 
                     Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son Demetrius I of Macedon unsuccessfully besieged 
                     Rhodes in 305 BC. According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 
                     70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high—the approximate height of the modern Statue of Liberty 
                     from feet to crown—making it the tallest statue of the ancient world. It collapsed during the 
                     earthquake of 226 BC; although parts of it were preserved, it was never rebuilt. For more info

                     Diana, a Roman goddess). It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day 
                     Turkey). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years 
                     later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient 
                     World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed. Only foundations and fragments of the last

                     sanctuary of Olympia, Greece, and erected in the Temple of Zeus there. A chryselephantine
                     sculpture of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden framework, it represented the god Zeus 
                     on a cedarwood throne ornamented with ebony, ivory, gold and precious stones. One of the 
                     Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the statue was lost and destroyed during the 5th century 
                     AD; details of its form are known only from ancient Greek descriptions and representations on coins.

                 was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC at Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, 
                 a satrap in the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was 
                 designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. Its elevated tomb structure is 
                 derived from the tombs of neighbouring Lycia, a territory Mausolus had invaded and annexed 
                 circa 460 BC, such as the Nereid Monument.To know more about this wonder refer the link given below.
